- routekeys.c:
   - threads-semaphore writing to stdout
   - SIGNALs handling
   - more complete (or deleting) ABS_XY->REL_XY translations
      -standard Xorg config do not allow ABS and REL on same uinput device
       ... primitive abs->rel translation implemented
      -gpm (tty mouse) worked well with both events
      -so this should be investigated more, or better translation todo.
